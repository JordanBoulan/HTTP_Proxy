Usage: run 'make' to create the two executables (client, server) in the current program.
To use client program: ./client username@hostname.com:port
To use server program: ./server port

The server program must be run before the client program!

Description:
This is a simple client/server program using tcp. The server listens on the specified port. 
The client program specifies a username. The server executes the linix "finger" program passing in the recieved username.
The server the output of finger is sent back to the client via the tcp connection.
The client/server is configured to handle 10 connections at once.
